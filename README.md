# Online Examination System - Django Project

## Project Overview

This project is an **Online Examination System** built using the Django framework. It provides functionalities for *students* to take online exams, *teachers* to create and manage courses and questions, and an *administrator* to oversee the entire system, including user management, teacher approvals, and content control. The system ensures secure access through robust **user authentication and authorization** and delivers a dynamic user interface through **templates**.
